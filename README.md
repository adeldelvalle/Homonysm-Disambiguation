# Homonysm-Disambiguation
Homonysm Disambiguation is a Natural Language Processing project that access Social Media data to disambiguate the sense of a word between two countries. It is a socio-linguistic oriented code with the purpose of showing the variation and distribution of words. 

This project is in its beginner phase. I wanted to do the disambiguation in Latin America, but due to the lack of spanish corpus, I will be changing it to disambiguate english words. In addition, I need a little help with the if statements of the geo locations. I tried to do it with a simple variable of the country, but for some reason the geo-location did not worked out that way.
